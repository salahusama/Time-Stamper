# Time-Stamper

This is my first _"real"_ android application. To make this, I had to learn Android development during my own time. [This](https://github.com/salahusama/learning-android/edit/master/README.md) is a link to the repo I used to learn Android development.

## The App

The home page is what you see when you open the application. It contains:
 - A big button to open the calendar view
 - Another big button to add a *"stamp"*
 - A stamp is a task or time-flag. So basically, you flag this instant on the calendar

This application displays the full current year as a horizontal, linear **set of cards**.
Each **card**
 - has a header area where it shows the date
 - has an area where tasks are shown.
 - can be customised to any color depending on the task

To add a stamp:
 - I made it very simple to add a stamp
 - You only name the stamp, then press the "STAMP!" button

## Technologies used

I used Android Studio for the first time to develop this application. As it was a learning experience, I did not want to go with OPENGL for graphics as it was too complex to learn that as well as Android Development - *although I tried*.

I ended up using an **Android Processing** for graphics. This was helpful as I already used Processing before, but not for Android develoment.

## What I learnt

 - The Android Studio platform
 - Using the Android documentation
 - Basic Android development libraries
